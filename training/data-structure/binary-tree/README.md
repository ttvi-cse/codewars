##Trees
- trees are hierachical data structures
##Tree Vocabulary
- topmost node is called root.
- the elements that are directly under an element are called its children.
- elements with no children are called leaves
##Why trees
- store information that naturally forms a hierarchy
- moderate access/search (quicker than linked list and slower than arrays)
- moderate insertion/deletion(quicker than arrays and slower than unordered linked lists)
- don't have an upper limit on number of nodes
###Main application of trees
##Binary Tree
- A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree.
##Properties
1. The maximm number of nodes at level i of a BT is 2^(k-1)
2. Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height h is 2^h-1
